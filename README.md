### Programing Language
I picked C# for my programing language. I picked it for a few reasons. The first is that it's a language I really want to learn more about.
The game engine Unity using C# as its primary scripting language, and learning to make games in Unity is something I'm interested in, so this seemed
like a good oppertunity to get more comfortable with the language. Another reason is simply the familiarity. It's a similar language to Java,
and it's Object Oriented, so I thought it might be easier to pick up. I was both right and wrong.

As far as libraries go, everything I needed was from the .NET framework. What I ended up needing to import from the framework was a csvparser class, 
a regex class, and a general IO library. These were all simply utility for making the base functionality of the program work. The CSV parser class
was the most useful, as I was thinking about using regex to parse that file as just splitting at the commas isn't good enough.
